# Portfolio Website - buzzigy

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built with React. It showcases my projects, skills, and experience.

## Getting Started Locally

To run this project on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url> # Replace with your repo URL
    cd buzzigy # Assuming 'buzzigy' is the repo directory
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm install

    # Or using yarn
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm start

    # Or using yarn
    yarn start
    ```
    This will usually open the project in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment

This project is typically deployed using Git. Here are the general steps:

1.  **Build for production:** Create an optimized build of the application.
    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm run build

    # Or using yarn
    yarn build
    ```
    This command usually creates a `build` or `dist` folder with the static assets.

2.  **Commit the changes:** Stage and commit your latest code changes (including the build folder if your deployment method requires it).
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Prepare for deployment"
    ```

3.  **Push to your hosting provider:** Push the changes to the Git repository connected to your hosting service.
    ```bash
    git push origin main # Or your deployment branch
    ```

**Hosting Platform Specifics:**

*   **GitHub Pages:** Configure your repository settings to deploy from the `build` folder on your chosen branch (often `gh-pages` or `main`). You might need to install the `gh-pages` package (`npm install gh-pages --save-dev`) and add a deploy script to your `package.json`.
*   **Netlify/Vercel:** Connect your Git repository to Netlify or Vercel. Configure the build command (e.g., `npm run build` or `yarn build`) and the publish directory (e.g., `build` or `dist`). Pushing to your designated branch will trigger automatic deployments.

Refer to the documentation of your specific hosting provider for detailed instructions.
